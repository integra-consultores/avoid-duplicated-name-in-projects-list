= avoid_duplicated_name_in_projects_list

This plugin modify the index page of projects to show ancestors' name (no link) of visible projects, even when ancestors are not visible.

This allows to distinguish between child projects with same name but different roots without compromising the confidentiality of all non visible projects.
